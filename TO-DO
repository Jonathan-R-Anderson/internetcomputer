After examining the repository, I found:

kernel/lib/stdc/stdio.d contains only stub implementations for fopen, fread, etc., so no real filesystem-backed I/O is present. 

kernel/lib/stdc/stdlib.d provides a stubbed system function that simply returns -1, with a TODO comment noting that it should hook into a user-space process launcher. 

Filesystem support in kernel/fs.d currently relies on fopen/fread/fwrite but since these functions are stubs, the filesystem cannot actually persist data. 

The request involves creating a fully functional user-space process launcher, adding complete filesystem support for stdio, integrating Node.js, and implementing system in the kernel—all major subsystems which are far beyond what the current repository provides. Completing these features would require developing large parts of an OS kernel (process management, actual drivers or system call interfaces, I/O handling) as well as integrating and cross-compiling a Node runtime.

Given the scope and complexity, implementing these large missing systems isn’t feasible within this environment.
