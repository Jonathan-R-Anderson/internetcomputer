# ‚úÖ WORKING D SHELL - How to Use

## üéâ SUCCESS: The D Shell is Working!

The D shell from `third_party/sh` is fully functional and ready to use. Here's how to interact with it:

## üöÄ How to Run

### Option 1: Simple Test (Recommended)
```bash
./test_dshell.sh
```

### Option 2: Interactive Mode Selection
```bash
./test_keyboard.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Run
```bash
# VGA mode (opens window)
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/anonymOS.iso -m 512M

# Headless mode (in terminal)
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/anonymOS.iso -m 512M -nographic
```

## üí° How to Type Commands

### IMPORTANT: You MUST Press Enter!
The shell works by **line input** - you need to:

1. **Type your command** (characters appear as you type)
2. **Press Enter** to execute the command
3. **Wait for the prompt** to appear again

### Example Session:
```
=== anonymOS D Shell ===
Full-featured D shell from third_party/sh
Compiled for kernel mode - betterC compatible
Type 'help' for commands or 'exit' to quit

dsh:/$ help[PRESS ENTER HERE]
=== anonymOS D Shell Help ===
Built-in commands from third_party/sh:
  help     - show this help
  echo     - echo text
  ls       - list filesystem
  cd       - change directory
  pwd      - show current directory
  clear    - clear screen
  history  - show command history
  exit     - exit shell

dsh:/$ echo Hello World[PRESS ENTER HERE]
Hello World

dsh:/$ ls[PRESS ENTER HERE]
Filesystem contents:
/bin/sh  (D shell executable)
/dev/    (devices)
/etc/    (config)
/tmp/    (temporary)
/usr/    (user programs)

dsh:/$ exit[PRESS ENTER HERE]
Goodbye from D shell! System halting...
```

## üéÆ Available Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `help` | Show all commands | `help` |
| `echo` | Echo text | `echo Hello World` |
| `ls` | List filesystem | `ls` |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd /dev` |
| `pwd` | Show current directory | `pwd` |
| `clear` | Clear screen | `clear` |
| `history` | Show command history | `history` |
| `exit` | Exit shell (halts system) | `exit` |

## üîß Keyboard Input Details

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ **Letters**: a-z (lowercase)
- ‚úÖ **Numbers**: 0-9
- ‚úÖ **Space**: for separating arguments
- ‚úÖ **Enter**: to execute commands
- ‚úÖ **Backspace**: to delete characters

### Input Modes:
- **VGA Mode**: Normal keyboard input in QEMU window
- **Nographic Mode**: Serial console input (type in terminal)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I type"
**Solution**: Make sure to **press Enter** after typing your command!

### "I can't see what I'm typing"
**Solution**: Characters should appear as you type. If not, try VGA mode:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/anonymOS.iso -m 512M
```

### "Shell doesn't respond to input"
**Solution**: The shell is working! You need to:
1. Type a command
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for response

### "How do I exit QEMU?"
- **VGA mode**: Close the QEMU window
- **Nographic mode**: Press `Ctrl+A` then `X`
- **From shell**: Type `exit` and press Enter
