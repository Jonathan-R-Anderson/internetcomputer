# D-based Lisp/Haskell Interpreter Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype for a Lisp-style interpreter written in [D](https://dlang.org/). The project is inspired by [Axel](https://github.com/axellang/axel), which translates a Lisp dialect to Haskell. In this repository we show how D can be used to build similar tooling that targets an environment with limited system commands such as those described in the [`internetcomputer`](https://github.com/Jonathan-R-Anderson/internetcomputer) project.

The implementation is intentionally small and demonstrates how one might begin to build a cross compiler or interpreter that uses the D toolchain. The code is located in `src/interpreter.d`.

## Building

A D compiler such as `dmd` or `ldc2` is required. The interpreter can now be
built with the full D runtime using the `build_full.sh` helper script:

```bash
./build_full.sh
```

`build_full.sh` assumes `ldc2` is available on your `PATH`. Adjust the script if
you prefer a different compiler or additional flags.

## Usage

```
./interpreter "+ 1 2"  # prints 3
```

The interpreter now supports a broader set of commands:

- `echo` – prints its arguments
- basic arithmetic with `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- variable assignment and expansion using `name=value` and `$name`
- directory commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, `pushd`, `popd`, and `dirs`
- Haskell-style `for` loops, e.g. `for 1..3 echo hi`
- concurrent commands using `&`, e.g. `echo one & echo two`
- `bg` to run a command in the background or resume a stopped job
- `fg` to bring a background job to the foreground
- `jobs` to list background jobs
- sequential commands separated by `;`
- file utilities such as `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `chattr`, and `chown`
 - text display commands like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, and `fgrep`
- `date` for the current time
 - schedule commands using `at`
 - run recurring scheduled jobs with `cron`
 - manage cron tables with `crontab`
- compression utilities with `bzip2`
- `dd` to copy and convert data in blocks
- `ddrescue` for data recovery from damaged disks
- `fdformat` to low-level format a floppy disk
- `df` to display free disk space
- `dmesg` to print kernel messages
- `fold` to wrap text to a fixed width
- `fsck` to check and repair filesystems
- `getfacl` to display file access control lists
- `groupadd` to create new groups
- `groupdel` to delete groups
- `eject` to eject removable media
- manage service runlevels with `chkconfig`
- `caller` to display the current call stack frame
- `exit` to terminate the shell with an optional status code

Running the interpreter with no command argument starts an interactive shell.
You can customize the prompt text using the `PS1` environment variable and its color with `PS_COLOR` (e.g. `PS_COLOR=green`). Type `exit` to leave the shell.
The shell now records command history which can be viewed with `history`.
Aliases may be managed with the `alias` builtin and removed using `unalias`.
You can repeat the previous command by typing `!!`.
Key sequences can be associated with commands using the `bind -x` builtin.
The `builtin` command runs one of the shell's builtins directly, bypassing alias expansion.
You can view a list of common Linux commands with the built-in `help` command,
which prints the contents of `commands.txt`.
The `apropos` command searches this help text for matching commands. It now
supports `-e` for exact matches, `-w` for shell wildcards, `-r` for regular
expressions and `-a` to require all keywords.

These examples demonstrate how additional Bash commands can be layered on top of a Haskell-inspired syntax. The goal remains to eventually cover the full Bash command set, including job control and other special operators.

## Building Pseudo Languages

A small lexer and parser framework inspired by Python's SLY is provided in
`src/dlexer.d` and `src/dparser.d`. These modules allow custom token rules and
implement a simple recursive-descent parser.

The sample program `src/example.d` evaluates arithmetic expressions using this
framework:

```bash
ldc2 src/example.d src/dlexer.d src/dparser.d -of=example
./example "1 + 2 * 3"   # prints 7
```

## Lisp Flavored Erlang Translator

The program `src/lfe.d` demonstrates how the lexer can be repurposed to build a
very small subset of [Lisp Flavored Erlang](https://lfe.io/). It parses a minimal
Lisp syntax and emits Erlang source code.

Build and run it with:

```bash
ldc2 src/lfe.d src/dlexer.d src/dparser.d -of=lfe
./lfe "(defmodule sample (export (add 2)) (defun add (x y) (+ x y)))"
```

This will print the generated Erlang code for the given expression.

## LFE REPL

A small interactive interpreter `src/lferepl.d` implements a minimal LFE-like REPL. Build it with:

```bash
ldc2 src/lferepl.d src/dlexer.d src/dparser.d -of=lferepl
./lferepl
```

Inside the REPL you can evaluate prefix expressions, assign variables and define functions:

```
lfe> (* 2 (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6))
42
lfe> (set multiplier 2)
2
lfe> (* multiplier (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6))
42
lfe> (defun double (x) (* 2 x))
0
lfe> (double 21)
42
lfe> (defmacro unless (test body)
      `(if (not ,test) ,body))
0
lfe> (unless (> 3 4) 'yes)
yes
lfe> (exit)
```

The REPL exits when `(exit)` is evaluated.

### Loading Modules

Simple modules can be loaded with `(c "file.lfe")`. Functions defined in a
`defmodule` form are stored using the `module:function` naming convention and can
be invoked after the file is compiled:

```lfe
lfe> (c "tut1.lfe")
#(module tut1)
lfe> (tut1:double 21)
42
```

### Language Features

The REPL implements a small but growing subset of LFE. Features currently
supported include:

- numeric, atom, tuple, list and map values with constructors and `map-update`
- quoting forms with `quote`, `backquote`, `comma` and `comma-at`
- variable binding using `(set ...)` and `(let ...)`
- pattern matching with `case`, `cond` and multi-clause `defun`
- guard expressions on function clauses
- record definitions via `defrecord` with generated accessors and setters
- macros using `defmacro` and `(macroexpand ...)`
- modules defined by `defmodule`; source files can be loaded with `(c "file.lfe")`
- basic I/O through `lfe_io:format` and utilities like `proplists:get_value`
- file operations like `(cp source dest)`
- concurrency primitives: `spawn`, `spawn_link`, `link`, `self`, message
  sending with `!`, `receive` and `process_flag` for `trap_exit`
- `(exit)` to leave the REPL

### Example Programs

Below are small samples demonstrating the syntax supported in the REPL.

#### Quoting and Unquoting

```lfe
lfe> '(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
lfe> `(a ,(+ 1 1) c)
(a 2 c)
```

#### Variables and Pattern Matching

```lfe
lfe> (set greeting "hi")
"hi"
lfe> (let ((list (tuple 1 2 3)))
       (case list
         ((tuple 1 x y) (+ x y))))
5
```

#### Records and Modules

```lfe
lfe> (defrecord person name age)
#(record person)
lfe> (c "tut24.lfe")
#(module tut24)
lfe> (tut24:demo)
to fred: hello
"goodbye"
```

#### Macros

```lfe
lfe> (defmacro unless (test body)
        `(if (not ,test) ,body))
lfe> (unless (> 2 3) 'ok)
ok
```

#### Concurrency

```lfe
lfe> (c "tut19.lfe")
#(module tut19)
lfe> (tut19:start)
Pong received ping
Ping received pong
Ping finished
Pong finished
```


#### Loop with Continue

```lfe
lfe> (c "tut25.lfe")
#(module tut25)
lfe> (tut25:demo)
1245
```

## Object System

The REPL now includes a minimal object oriented layer implemented in `objectsystem.d`. Objects are referenced by an identifier and can be manipulated through new builtins:

```
(resolve path)           ; locate an object by path
(bind src dst)           ; bind an existing object to a new path
(clone obj)              ; duplicate an object
(delete obj)             ; remove an object
(list obj)               ; list child names
(introspect obj)         ; return object info string
(rename obj new)         ; rename an object
(getType obj)            ; return the type string
(getProp obj key)        ; fetch a property
(setProp obj key val)    ; set a property value
(listProps obj)          ; list property keys
(delProp obj key)        ; delete a property
(listMethods obj)        ; list method names
(call obj method args..) ; invoke a method (placeholder)
(describeMethod obj m)   ; describe a method
(createObject type)      ; create a new object of a type
(instantiate classPath)  ; alias for createObject
(defineClass path def)   ; stub for class definitions
(attach parent child alias)
(detach parent name)
(getParent obj)
(getChildren obj)
(sandbox obj)
(isIsolated obj)
(seal obj)
(verify obj)
```

These commands provide a simple demonstration of integrating an OOP style with the existing LFE interpreter written in D.
