# Distributed Filesystem

Experimental cryptographic filesystem aimed at decentralized storage. The files
here are synced from the
[distributedFS](https://github.com/Jonathan-R-Anderson/distributedFS)
repository. Use `../../scripts/fetch_modules.sh` to clone or update the module
so integration stays aligned with upstream development.
