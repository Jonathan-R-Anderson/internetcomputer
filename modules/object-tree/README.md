# Object Namespace

An object-based hierarchy that exposes kernel services through a single tree.
The contents of this directory are pulled from the
[anonymos-object-tree](https://github.com/Jonathan-R-Anderson/anonymos-object-tree)
repository. Running `../../scripts/fetch_modules.sh` will clone or update the
sources automatically so this project always integrates the latest changes.
