Here's a comprehensive roadmap for your operating system project based on your objectives and the technologies you’ve mentioned: blockchain, Tor, Ubuntu Core design, NixOS-style declarative configuration, and Plan 9 principles. This roadmap is structured into stages from foundational system design to full feature integration.

🧱 Tier 1: Core OS Infrastructure
✅ Boot and Kernel Foundation
 Bootloader support (GRUB, Syslinux, or custom)

 Kernel written in D with:

Paging

Context switching

Ring 3 support (for user-mode multitasking)

 GDT/TSS correctly configured

 Interrupt and syscall interface

 Scheduler and multitasking

✅ Memory and Process Management
 Slab/stack-based memory allocator

 Virtual memory with user/kernel space separation

 System calls with safe argument passing (no unsafe casts)

 Per-process address spaces and file descriptors

📦 Tier 2: Plan 9 + NixOS + Ubuntu Core-inspired Design
✅ Namespaces and FS Unification (Plan 9-style)
 Everything is a file/device (keyboard, net, windows, etc.)

 Private namespaces per process

 Mount and bind system like Plan 9

✅ Declarative System Configuration (NixOS-style)
 Config file (/writable/system/config.toml)

 Declarative fields for:

Hostname, timezone, boot apps, services

Network interfaces

Blockchain node config

 Immutable root with mutable overlay (/writable)

✅ Snap-like Modular App Design (Ubuntu Core-style)
 Each service (shell, tor.d, eth.d, etc.) is a "snap"

 Isolated sandboxed environments

 Snaps defined in config and mounted dynamically at boot

 Optional AppArmor/seccomp integration

🔐 Tier 3: Security and Privacy Layer
✅ Tor Integration
 Built-in tor.d service as a snap

 Network routing via .onion as default

 Hidden service configuration exposed in config file

✅ Cryptographic Identity
 User authentication via Ethereum address

 Signing actions using private keys (GPG or Ethereum-based)

 Zero-trust design for inter-process messaging

⛓️ Tier 4: Blockchain and Distributed Tech Integration
✅ Blockchain Data Layer
 eth.d snap to manage Ethereum/zkSync/Rootstock node

 Immutable data store for logs or config diffs (IPFS, Swarm, or Magnet)

 Smart contract interaction for:

Thread/Post creation

Token-based voting (DAO)

Profile and access rights

✅ Distributed P2P Services
 BitTorrent seeding via torrent.d snap

 Trackerless DHT node baked into the OS

 WebSeed or Flask-based temp-seed bootstrap for swarm

🧠 Tier 5: System Interaction and Admin Tools
✅ Init and Shell
 init as a userspace snap that loads other services

 shell snap for user interaction

 Debug shell exposed only to sysadmin

✅ SysAdmin Control Panel
 Snap or interface for:

Snap lifecycle management

Blockchain-based ban/whitelist

Thread moderation

 Ability to cancel votes via token authority

🌐 Tier 6: Network, DNS, and Federation
✅ Decentralized DNS
 dns.d snap using CoreDNS

 Mask .onion addresses with .gremlin TLD

 CLI tool to add/remove new names

✅ VPN Access Layer
 VPN access via OpenVPN snap

 User-specific .ovpn generated via their Ethereum profile

 Network isolation within container networks

✅ Federation
 Optional federation with other nodes (Spaz or Gremlin OS instances)

 Gossip protocol for metadata sync

🧪 Tier 7: Testing, Simulation, and Sandboxing
✅ Dev Containers and App Sandboxes
 QEMU or v86 virtual containers

 User apps run in sandboxed namespaces

 Resource-limited snap profiles

✅ Snapshotting and Rollbacks
 Declarative snapshots of filesystem/config

 Optional Rollback Rx for external storage

🌌 Tier 8: UX, Web, and Tooling
✅ Front-End and Dashboard
 Web UI hosted via internal snap

 Status of snaps, logs, and blockchain interactions

✅ Smart Contract Interface
 Auto-injection of ABI + contract address to web frontend

 Local dApp explorer (similar to Remix or Metamask)

✅ CLI Utilities
 gremlinctl to manage snaps, config, user identity, and system health
